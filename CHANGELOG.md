## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Refreshed adapter documentation for current command names, compatibility, context injection, configuration collisions, vendored content, and troubleshooting.
- Synced vendored beads files to v1.0.5

### Fixed

- Adapted upstream MCP-oriented command and task-agent prompts to OpenCode's CLI-only execution model.
- Made context injection concurrency-safe, retryable, directory-aware, and consistent with the latest session context.
- Preserved the newest eligible model and agent context when reinjecting after compaction.
- Scoped all shell and OpenCode SDK operations to the active project with explicit worktree fallback.
- Made vendor sync dry runs non-mutating and isolated real syncs from the caller's checkout and unrelated files.

### Added

- Added plugin contract tests, packed-package smoke coverage, and locked pull-request CI.

## [0.2.1]

### Changed

- Strengthened agent delegation guidance to default to using `beads-task-agent` for any multi-command or context-gathering work
- Added explicit guidance for status overview queries ("what's next", "what's blocked") to use the agent instead of running multiple `bd` commands
- Split guidance into session-specific (when to delegate) and subagent-specific (how to behave) contexts
- Added subagent awareness instructions explaining that final message is returned to calling agent
- Added output format guidance for subagent to return concise summaries instead of raw JSON dumps

## [0.2.0]

### Changed

- Enhanced beads guidance with agent delegation section to help models automatically use `beads-task-agent` for multi-step work

## [0.1.2]

### Fixed

- Fixed context injection being skipped when other plugins inject messages first by checking for actual `<beads-context>` tag instead of just message count

## [0.1.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicate context injection caused by plugin being loaded twice due to having both named and default exports

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Initial release of beads issue tracker integration for OpenCode
- Automatic context injection via `bd prime` on session start and after compaction
